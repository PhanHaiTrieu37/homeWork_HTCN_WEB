            One particularly highly recommended book is <u>The Street Attorney</u> by <u>John Grisham</u>.

             a bad incident occurs in his law firm.  So he gets acquainted with the city's streets
             , and recognizes the harsh existence of the homeless, and vows to give them a chance in court.
               <u>The Street Lawyer</u> is a <b>great</b> book.  It is <b>well written</b> and <b>interesting</b>.
              <u>John Grisham's</u> other books include <u>The Firm</u>, <u>The Pelican Brief</u>, and <u>The Client</u>
